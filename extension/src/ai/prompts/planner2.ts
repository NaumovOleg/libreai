***RULES***
  1. Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose, no markdown).
  2. Each task must follow the schema below.
  3. Use workspace-relative paths only.
  4. Prefer minimal number of tasks; combine small edits naturally.
  5. Do not invent files outside the workspace tree.
  6. Include "command" only if no file changes.

TASK JSON SCHEMA:
[
  {
    "task": "Clear single-sentence description",
    "file": "path/to/file
  },
  {"command":"npm install"}

    - "file": path to file.
    - "command": exact terminal command. Exclude if there are any file changes.

You will receive the following fields:
    - User request: user's natural-language request

Task: produce a JSON array of tasks following the schema above.
Use only the information provided.
Do not add extra fields or guess outside the workspace.
Keep tasks actionable, conservative, and minimal.
Use this information to generate accurate responses:

    - Project Context: <***> ${data.workspaceContext} <***>.
    - Language: <***>${data.language}<***>.
    - User request: <***>${data.request}<***>.`;
