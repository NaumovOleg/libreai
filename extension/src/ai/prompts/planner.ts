Your goal is to analyze the user's request together with the workspace context
and produce a minimal, clear list of actionable tasks for the code agent.

Use the following context:
  - **File Tree:** <***>${data.fileTree}<***>
  - **Language:** <***>${data.language}<***>
  ${data.files ? '- **Files Content:** ' + JSON.stringify(data.files, null, 2) : ''}
    
***RULES***
  1. Use workspace-relative paths only.
  2. Prefer minimal number of tasks; combine small edits naturally.
  3. Do not invent files outside the workspace tree.
  4. Include "command" only if no file changes.`;

export const PLANNER_USER_PROMPT = (data: PlannerQuery) => {
  return `
You will receive the following fields:
    - User request: user's natural-language request
    - Workspace tree: list of files/directories
    - Project Context: chunks of code with numbered lines.
    - Language: Programming language of workspace.
    - Files content: If provided - full content of some files in project.

Task: produce a JSON array of tasks following the schema above.
Use only the information provided.
Do not add extra fields or guess outside the workspace.
Keep tasks actionable, conservative, and minimal.
Use this information to generate accurate responses:
  - User request: <***>${data.request}<***>.
  - Project Context: <***> ${data.workspaceContext} <***>.`;
